# AdaptingGravity.Physics.Manipulation Namespace
 

The AdaptingGravity.Physics.Manipulation namespace modifies objects in a way that is not physically accurate but can help to restrict objects to do certain that can otherwise be problematic for gameplay. 

## Examples
The player should always have its feet on the ground and should not rotate while it is moving. To stop that, the up vector of the player can always be set to the current normal of the ground.
