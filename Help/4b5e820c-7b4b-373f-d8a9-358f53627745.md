# PlayerState Enumeration
 

Is used to define the current states the player is in right now. The player can be in more than one state, that's why a normal enum would not work The states should only be checked and manipulated through the methods 
```
EnableState(PlayerState stateToEnable)
DisableState(PlayerState stateToDisable)
HasState(PlayerState stateToEvaluate)
```
